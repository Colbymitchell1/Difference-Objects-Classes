# Difference-Objects-Classes

This project demonstrates the differences between classes and objects in Java.

Objects vs Classes

A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines attributes and behaviors common to all objects of that type. A class doesn't take up memory until an instance (object) is created from it.

An object is an instance of a class. It is a specific implementation of the class and takes up memory. Objects have actual values assigned to their attributes, and they can use the behaviors (methods) defined in the class.

## Example Program

The example program creates two objects (myCar and anotherCar) from the Car class. The objects represent real-world cars with unique attributes like model, color, and speed. These objects can call methods to perform actions like starting, stopping, and accelerating.

# How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the program to see how objects are created and interact with the class.
